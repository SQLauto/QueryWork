# QueryWork
Various MSSQL maintenance and troubleshooting scripts.
These are MS SQL Server scripts I have developed, copied, extended, etc. over my years as a DBA.
The scripts are mostly SQL2008R2 and later.
Most of the scripts are pretty well commented and generally include links to the original articles or BLOGs that
they were inspired by or copied from.
None of these scripts are really finished.  I often modify them while in use.
Some are really just barely started. For example a script might have been started to work on a particular problem which was
ultimately resolved someother way.

I set these up under the GNU Public License 3.0 and have made a good faith effort to ensure I did not violate copyrights of any of
the developers works that I copied/modified.  I don't really care what you do with this code as long as you don't blame me :)

Use at your own risk :)
