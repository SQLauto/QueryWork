# QueryWork
Various MSSQL maintenance and troubleshooting scripts.
These are MS SQL Server scripts I have developed, copied, extended, etc. over my years as a DBA.
The scripts are mostly SQL2008R2 and above.
Most of the scripts are pretty well commented and generally include links to the original articles or BLOGs that
they were inspired by or copied from.
None of these are really finished.  I often modify them while in use.
Some are really just barely started. For example a script might be started to work on a particular problem which was
ultimately resolved someother way.

Use at your own risk :)
